***IMPORTANT***
integrate classes into module, to facilitate interfacing
build bruteforcer
build portscanner
fill out undefined methods

FOR ORIGINAL DEV: FIX ALL LAZY PROGRAMMING OUT OF RESPECT FOR OTHERS
example: @verbosity = $stdin.gets.chomp.to_i

i realize this is awful, but i was trying to throw the whole thing together as quickly as possible


***MISC***
clean README
separate files into modules
look into support for inline bashscripting (for instance, nmap -sL [range] to generate hosts)
